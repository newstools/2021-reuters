(Reuters) - Cozen O'Connor is continuing to expand its government relations subsidiary in the midwest, bringing on a full-time lobbyist from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker's office. The law firm's lobbying arm, Cozen O'Connor Public Strategies, has added Sydney Corryn Holman to its Chicago and Illinois practices, the firm said Monday. Holman spent two and half years working for Pritzker's office, where she was a deputy director of legislative affairs and house liaison of legislative affairs. Holman said she will leverage her government experience to help Cozen O'Connor clients advance their legislative agenda in Springfield and Chicago. Cozen O'Connor launched its public strategies subsidiary in 2009. According to its website, the group now has more than 40 lobbyists based in Washington, D.C., Richmond, Albany, New York City, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Chicago and Santa Monica. Patrick Martin, the managing director of Cozen O'Connor Public Strategies' Chicago office, said the lobbying group has been growing its midwest branch since he joined in 2018 from McGuireWoods Consulting. It now has six lawyers and lobbyists focused on the city, county and state government in Illinois, he said. "In the course of the last three years, we built out a pretty sizable team," Martin said. "And bringing Sydney on was just sort of the next step of that."
