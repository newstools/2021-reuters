(Reuters) - Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is guiding French construction materials company Saint-Gobain in its purchase of GCP Applied Technologies, a deal that values the U.S. construction chemicals provider at roughly $2.3 billion. The companies announced the transaction on Monday, roughly two months after Saint-Gobain expanded its construction chemicals offerings through another acquisition. Saint-Gobain is working with a Freshfields team led by corporate and merger and acquisitions partners Joseph Halloum and Ethan Klingsberg. Other attorneys contributing to the deal include corporate partner Olivier Rogivue and counsel Raphael Darmon, the firm said in an email. Rogivue was among a group of Freshfields attorneys who advised Saint-Gobain on the sale of its stake in its distribution unit in Germany, according to a press release. On the other side of the deal, GCP has turned to a Latham & Watkins team led by corporate partners Bradley Faris and Jason Morelli, with capital markets advice from partners Peter Labonski and Benjamin Stern, the firm said in a statement. GCP’s financial adviser is RBC Capital Markets LLC, and Saint-Gobain's advisers are Lazard and Citi. The deal is expected to close in 2022’s second half.
