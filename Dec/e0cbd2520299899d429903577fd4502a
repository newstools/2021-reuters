MOSCOW, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor has filed  cases against U.S. tech firms Google and Meta that could see fines imposed on their annual turnover in Russia, a Moscow court said on Friday. Roskomnadzor in October threatened both Alphabet's Google (GOOGL.O) and Meta's Facebook (FB.O) with fines based on a percentage of their annual turnover for a repeated failure to delete content that Moscow deems illegal.  read more  Russian law allows for companies to be fined between 5% and 10% of annual turnover for repeated violations. Moscow's Tagansky District Court said court dates for both companies - neither of which immediately responded to a request for comment - were set for Dec. 24.
